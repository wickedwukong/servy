# Pattern matching on Map and use it to implement route


**new request**

request = """
GET /wildlife HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: ExampleBrowser/1.0
Accept: */*

"""

we want to handle /wildlife same as /wildthings by rewriting the /wildlife to /wildthings

**Map Pattern Matching**

- %{method: "GET"} = %{method: "GET", path: "/wildthings"} is a match
- %{method: method, path: path} = %{method: "GET", path: "/wildthings"} is a match, and we can capture method and path here
